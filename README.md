## How to run locally with docker

Our Docker compose file creates a container with all necessary dependencies ready to use.
Steps: 
1. Clone the project.
2. Create a .env file based on .env.example.
3. Add a tokens.json file to /services/extract_service.
4. Create the containers using the docker-compose.local.yml ` docker compose -f docker-compose.local.yml up `.

## Format of tokens.json 
The tokens.json file contains the tokens to extract information from the GitHub API. 
The GitHub API allows up to 5,000 calls per token per hour.
tokens.json format:

`{ "keys": [ "ghp_", "ghp_", "ghp_" ] } `

If the token doesn't exist in the extract_service, you should see an error in the log.
